1. Upon finding this webpage, a user will find that it is self explanatory. In our Html code, we added placeholders to the search criteria. It gives the webpage users a good idea on how to search for data.
2. If there is an item you are searching for, after typing the info in. Any action will refresh the page to get your search criteria. Whether it's a mouse click or pressing enter.
3. If you have multiple search criteria, then you use the other search bars as well.
4. if you are no longer searching for an item, you can delete your text to reset it.

## Summary
**One drawback and two recommendations:**
- One drawback is that we have a limited data range and do not specify what that range is.
- We can turn a few of the search categories into a menu/navigation bar. Such as the State and shape category
- We can add a reset button that will start back at the beginning. So basically a button that links to the orginal page.
